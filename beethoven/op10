With the Three Sonatas Op. 10 we enter the most dramatic period in
Beethoven's life. One can only imagine what he must have felt,
knowing the part of him most vital to his activity as a musician was damaged.
The letter to Wegeler tells us;
to those who might object that the disease was only in its beginnings,
and that the greatest distress would only come when the deafness was total,
we say that for all humans it is the moment of discovery of
an incurable disease which is the tragic moment.
In the letter to Wegeler, Beethoven confesses that no treatment
had brought any improvement,
and that his hearing was so diminished that in the theatre
he was obliged to sit in the front rows.
Also, he says that if people don't speak up he can't hear them,
but that if they shout that causes him great suffering.
We will not here talk of the various conlicting diagnoses
which have been suggested; what interests us is to find in his
works from the period covered by the letter to Wegeler
testimony of his mental life, and to the influence that this life 
might have had on his works.

In fact, I am still surprised to see so many commentators
failing to note the clear effects on his compositions
caused by the drama of his deafness.
At best, commentators might admit that the <I>largo e mesto</I>
of the <B><I>Sonata in D</I></B> (the number 3 of the opus) might display a
profound sadness of its author; but they wait until the
<B><I>Sonata Pathetique</I></B> before making the link between the
misfortune and the music, and even then more because of the title
than because of the musical content.

But a musician trained from the start to create ideas linked to his
emotions, as Beethoven was (by Neefe), cannot even begin to write
without the state of his emotions being reflected in his work.

How can they imagine that Beethoven, obessed by the treat of increasing
deafness, sitting at his piano or at his table, could be free of all
preoccupations ?
<A NAME="p62"></A>
Or that his choice of ideas, and their treatment,
should not betray the states of mind which occur under an obsession ?
We use the words "states of mind which occur" because no
young man at the height of his physical and mental powers will let
himself be plunged without fighting back into pain and unhappiness;
there will be times of despair, and times when he feels that unhappiness
can not possibly be inevitable;
there will be times of discouragement
and moments when his problems are forgotten,
times of reasonable discussion, of facing up to the worst,
and moments of frivolous gaiety.

This is what we are going to see the the <B><I>Three Sonatas Op. 10</I></B>:
the surges of determination, the falls into doubt;
revolt and acceptance, irony against the absurdity of such a trial,
and glimpses of an interior light.
All these feelings, mastered and put into a work of art,
the reconciliation of their intellectual logic
and of the needs of the art-work's form.

These three sonatas, therefore,
form a kind of grand poem, in which the different phases of the trial
are translated.

The first sonata reveals the emotional shock,
and the crystallisation of this shock into the idea of Fate.
The association with the word "Destiny" with that famous rhythm
of which we have already pointed out several examples,
is already established as a fact.
And from that, the whole sonata becomes clear;
the somewhat tense elans of a man who knows himself to be at his full strength,
alternating with doubt
and that inner trembling the precursor of future storms,
the aspiration (in his letter to Wengeler, Beethoven tells of his dream
of dedicating his art to the poor and disinherited),
the evocation of the great dream of a love shared
which will haunt him and which he feels threatened,
all this is what provokes in him feelings of despair and revolt.

These internal changes, this moving mental landscape,
this is the musical substance of the first piece and opf the <I>adagio</I>.
There is no <I>scherzo</I>, of course, in this drama.
