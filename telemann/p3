The \f2Twelve Fantasias for Flute\fP
are offered here in a new edition for recorder.
Two versions are available, one written for the recorder in C
(e.g. soprano or tenor) and the other for the recorder in F (e.g. alto, bass).
The version for the C recorder can of course be read transposing on the alto
by using descant fingering, and this may well be the preferred
approach for alto players as it saves reading a great number of ledger lines.
All marks of expression are editorial and are suggestions only;
they may be ignored with a clear conscience.

Flute music from this era is normally played on alto recorder by
transposing it up three semitones, so that the bottom D of the flute
is played as the bottom F of the alto recorder.
These Fantasias are not all playable using that transposition,
and several have been given here at original pitch on the C\ recorder
(or transposed up five semitones on the F\ recorder).

Two versions are provided of Fantasia 5, originally in C major.
In the key of Bb on the C\ recorder (or Eb on the F\ recorder)
every note is within range,
but the piece does not seem to me to have a Bb or Eb character,
and the opening fanfare is awkward.
It sounds brighter in C (or F),
but bar 23 of the Allegro reaches top E (or A),
and a top C# (or F#) appears at the start of bar 24.
So both versions are provided, enabling the reader to choose.

Fantasias 9, 10 and 12 also involve a top C# (or F#),
and Fantasia 6 involves a difficult low Eb (or Ab);
more playable alternatives are provided in small print.
