These scores are something I always wanted to have when I was figerpicking
steel-strung guitars in the the folk clubs of London in the 1960s.

Included are instrumentals for solo guitar,
all in standard tuning, including a couple of my own,
but mostly from the early albums of Bert Jansch and Davey Graham.

This was a moment of great creativity,
because there were no rules, no teaching tradition;
these people just took up the guitar
and asked 'hmm, what can I do with this thing?'.
.LP

They played usually with a Capo on the third fret,
and mostly in triplet-rhythm,
which I have notated in 12/16 and 9/16
so I can make the beats clearer by grouping them under the same beam.

Bert Jansch was exploring the sound of alternating between an open string
and the same note fingered on the next lower string, letting both vibrate.
He later described 'The Wheel' as "the sort of thing most guitarists
have up their sleeves, little bits and pieces they throw away or forget".
In the classical tradition, this splicing together of 
repeated motifs ('little bits') is associated with the Russian tradition  -
Stravinsky's \f2 The Rite of Spring \fP is a good example -
and it was also much used on 'progressive rock' albums,
in that case usually by splicing the tape.
