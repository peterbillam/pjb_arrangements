These score are something I always wanted to do when I was
figerpicking steel-strung guitars in the the folk clubs of London in the 1960s.

They include instrumentals for solo guitar,
all in standard tuning,
from the early albums of Bert Jansch, Davey Graham and Stefan Grossman.

mostly with the Capo on the third fret

mostly in triplet-rhythm,
which I have notated in 12/16 and 9/16
so I can make the rhythm clearer by grouping beats under the same beam.

Bert Jansch was exploring the sound of alternating between an open string
and the same note fingered on the next lower string, letting both vibrate.
