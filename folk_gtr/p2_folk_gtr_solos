\f3\s+6Finger-style Folk-guitar Instrumentals\s0\fP

These scores are something I always wanted to have when I was figerpicking
steel-strung guitars in the the folk clubs of London in the late 1960s.
.LP
.nh
Included are instrumentals for solo guitar,
all in standard tuning, including a couple of my own,
but mostly from the early albums of
Davey Graham, Stefan Grossman and Bert Jansch.
Everyone trying to play the folk guitar must own those albums !
not to mention those by John Renbourn, Al Stewart, John Martyn,
Roy Harper, Dando Shaft, the Incredible String Band . . .
it was a moment of great creative flowering.
.\" with no rules, no teaching tradition;
.\" these people just took up the guitar
.\" and worked out 'hmm, what can I do with this thing?'.

They played usually with a Capo on second or third fret,
and mostly in triplet-rhythm,
which I have notated in 12/16 and 9/16
to make the beats clearer by grouping them under the same beam. \ 
If anyone makes a tablature edition of these pieces, please let me know.

Davey Graham was
playing jazz standards - tune, chords and bass -
just as a piano trio could.
And not so much by brute virtuosity, as by intelligence:
by letting the arrangement grow out from the guitar.
Just consult \f2 Cry Me a River \fP on \f2 youtube \fP to see
how naturally the playing lies on Davey's six strings.

Stefan Grossman came in from the US, having studied not just
in New York with the Reverend Gary Davis,  but also down south with
Mississippi John Hurt, Son House, Skip James, Mississippi Fred McDowell,
so carrying in him a huge, rich tradition.

Bert Jansch was exploring the sound of alternating between an open string
and the same note fingered on the next lower string, letting both vibrate.
He later described 'The Wheel' as "the sort of thing most guitarists
have up their sleeves, little bits and pieces they throw away or forget".
In the classical tradition, this splicing together of 
repeated motifs ('little bits') is associated with Russian music  -
Stravinsky's \f2 The Rite of Spring \fP is a example -
and it was also much used on 'progressive rock' albums,
in that case usually by splicing the tape.
