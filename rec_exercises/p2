\f3\s+6Daily Recorder Exercises\s0\fP

The first two pages of these exercises date from 1995,
when I was a tutor in the \f2Recorder\ '95\fP festival in Melbourne.
Why should recorder players practice in remote keys like F# major ?
Because in almost every piece in B minor, and hence even in D major,
there is some passage in the dominant, in this case F# major,
and unless the player has practised in this key,
that passage is always the one which spoils the whole movement.

The third page, of minor arpeggios,
was added recently because I noticed that while sight-reading
I was playing the major arpeggios with greater fluency than minor ones.

Systematic technical exercises such as these
are less used by recorder players than other instrumentalists,
but they are very effectice in generating
a maximum of fluency from a minimum of playing time.
They should be used regularly every day;
ten minutes a day is far superior to one hour per week.

The goal when practising should be to let each note sing strongly and sweetly
right from its very first moment to its very last,
and then to change cleanly into the next note,
with the tongue and all the fingers moving simultaneously
so that no ugly scrunching sounds mar the transition.
As the transitions become flawless,
the sweet singing line will begin to join up from note to note,
and develops into a large thing which has its own identity and beauty.

These exercises should also be of value to other woodwind instruments
such as flute, oboe, clarinet or saxophone.
