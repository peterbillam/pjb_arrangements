.sp 1.1c
.Lp
These well-known pieces should be useful to
beginnning players of the Bb trumpet.
They are tuneful, memorable and free from copyright.
Also included are some scale and arpeggio exercises,
so that the more remote keys are not neglected.
The highest note demanded is the g at the top of the clef.
The pieces are arranged in approximately alphabetical order of title.
They were typeset using \f3muscript\fP (see \f2www.pjb.com.au/muscript\fP).
