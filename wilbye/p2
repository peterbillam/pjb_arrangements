\f3\s+6Draw on, sweet Night, by John Wilbye\s0\fP
.sp 0.8c
.LP
John Wilbye was born at Diss in Norfolk in 1574,
the third son of Matthew Wilbye,
a prosperous tanner, local landholder and amateur lutenist.
Within a few miles of Diss was Brome Hall,
the seat of Sir Thomas Cornwallis,
and John Wilbye's musical talents attracted the attention of the Hall.
.LP
In 1593, shortly after Cornwallis' daughter Elizabeth was married to
Sir Thomas Kytson of Hengrave Hall near Bury St. Edmunds in Suffolk,
John Wilbye was appointed a household musician to the Kytsons,
and remained in their service for thirty years.
In 1598 Wilbye published his
\f2First Set of Madrigals to 3. 4. 5. and 6. Voices\fP,
containing thirty great madrigals, including the bright
\f2Flora gave me fairest flowers\fP and
\f2Adieu sweet Amaryllis\fP,
and the darker
\f2Of joys and pleasing pains\fP and
\f2Alas what a wretched life\fP.
.LP
Sir Thomas died in 1602, but Lady Kytson maintained Hengrave Hall
in the same degree of state.
In 1609 Wilbye published
\f2The Second Set of Madrigals To 3. 4. 5. and 6. parts,
apt both for Voyals and Voices\fP
which contains thirty-four great compositions,
including the bright
\f2Sweet honey-sucking bees\fP and
\f2Stay, Corydon\fP
and the darker
\f2Oft have I vowed\fP,
and number 31, \f2Draw On Sweet Night\fP :

.DS B
Draw on, sweet Night, best friend unto those cares
\ \ \ That do arise from painful melancholy.
My life so ill through want of comfort fares,
\ \ \ That unto thee I consecrate it wholly.
.sp 0.3c
Sweet Night, draw on ! My griefs, when they are told
\ \ \ To shades and darkness, find some ease from paining,
And while thou all in silence dost enfold,
\ \ \ I then shall have best time for my complaining.

The poet has not been identified.
This six-part setting lies half way between
Wilbye's abstract, purely musical style, and his madrigal style.
Together with \f2The Lady Oriana\fP,
which Wilbye contributed to the \f2Triumphs of Oriana\fP collection,
and two motets which he contributed to Leighton's
\f2Teares or Lamentations\fP,
these two sets of madrigals constitute Wilbye's entire output
and place him together with Byrd, Morley and Weelkes
as one of the greatest of English composers.
.LP
In 1613 Lady Kytson granted Wilbye a lease of Sexten's Farm,
reputed the best sheep farm in the district.
Wilbye employed a bailiff to run the farm,
and continued to live at Hengrave Hall,
but his new interest seems to have ended his composing;
perhaps such an activity was not appropriate
for the landed gentleman he was now becoming.
.LP
After Lady Kytson's death in 1628,
Wilbye went to live at the house of Lady Rivers in Colchester.
Lady Rivers, a few years older than Wilbye,
was the youngest daughter of Sir Thomas Kytson,
and had always been a particular patroness of the composer.
Her marriage to Lord Rivers had not been happy,
and when she left the family seat at St. Osyth
she moved to Colchester, some nine miles distant.
Lady Rivers' house still stands today, as indeed does Hengrave Hall.
.LP
Wilbye died in 1638 and was buried at Holy Trinity, Colchester.
He bequeathed a comparatively important estate,
mostly to his nephews and nieces.
He owned four hundred pounds, and land around Bury St. Edmunds and around Diss.
His best viol went to Charles, Prince of Wales, later Charles II.
