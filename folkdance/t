There are four polkas:
\f2Davvy Davvy Knick Knack\fP,
\f2Spanish Ladies\fP,
\f2I'll tell me Ma\fP and
\f2The Glen Cottage Polkas\fP;
two hornpipes
\f2Castlekelly\fP and
\f2Cronin's Hornpipe\fP;
two jigs:
\f2Lannigan's\fP and
\f2The Rambling Pitchfork\fP;
two mazurkas:
\f2The Munster Cloak\fP and
\f2Sonny's Mazurka\fP;
a reel
\f2The Old Grey Gander\fP
and an old Scottish tune,
\f2Over the Sea to Skye\fP;
a set dance
\f2The Humours of Bandon\fP
and the old English tune
\f2Greensleeves\fP.

These dance tunes are from the Australian tradition,
which is very strongly based in its Irish roots.
The tunes can be played on descant recorder, or on tin whistle, violin,
concertina, or any treble-clef instrument which comes to hand.
The low B in the \f2Glen Cottage Polkas\fP is fine on violin or concertina;
on recorder or whistle it would be best taken as a G.
The accompaniment is for guitar, and the guitar parts are not difficult.
Some of the accompaniments fit on four strings
and could be played on tenor banjo.
For the \f2Humours of Bandon\fP two alternative accompaniments are offered;
if two guitars are available they sound good if both played together.

The Polkas would go at about 138 crochets/min,
Jigs and Reels at about 60 bars/min, Hornpipes about 80 minims/min.
Typically, these dances would be played through twice,
then followed by another of the same type.
The \f2Humours of Bandon\fP is a set dance that would go at about
108 dotted crochets per minute.

In reels and hornpipes quavers are played with a lilt,
like the \f2inégale\fP of baroque music;
the first quaver of each pair is a little longer than the second,
but definitely not twice as long.
So if what you're playing sound like even quavers, you give it more of a lilt,
but if it sounds like crochet-quaver in a triplet rhythm,
you make them more even again.
Jigs are also played with a lilt; in each group of three quavers,
the first is made a little longer and the second a little shorter.

In the Irish tradition, ornaments are much used,
and it's not done to play a tune the same way twice.
The Irish "roll" is similar to the "turn" of classical music,
but the auxiliary notes are played much shorter than the three main notes,
like two little grace-note accaciaturas,
and unlike the five even notes of the classical "turn".
Each instrument will ornament differently,
conforming to its technical possibilities.
The only real way to learn about these things
is to listen to the great players.
In the Australian branch of the tradition, tunes are not so much ornamented.
