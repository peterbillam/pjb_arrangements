\f3\s+7Some Famous Beginnings\s0\fP
.sp 2.2c

.Lp
This is a collection of beginnings of some famous pieces,
arranged for piano,
and suitable for sight-reading practice or just affectionate curiosity.
A teacher, for example, could ask a pupil to read one of the pieces,
and then play the pupil a recording of the same passage on a CD;
this should broaden the student's overview of the western art-music culture.

.Lp
A piano can play much of the repertoire of other instruments;
indeed this is one of the reasons that so many of the greatest
composers have been great keyboard players.

.Lp
Present are, in mostly chronological order:
some famous fugue-themes by Johann Sebastian Bach including
BWV846, BWV869, BWV538, BWV542, BWV1080, and BWV1079,
