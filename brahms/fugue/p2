Brahms wrote his Fugue in Ab minor for Organ around 1846,
the year in which Robert Schumann,
the great composer and Brahms' great friend, mentor and champion,
died after a prolonged period of madness.
The Ab minor Fugue is a particularly introverted and searching work,
in slow tempo and extremely sombre key.

.LP
This arrangement is taken from Brahms' 1864 revision.
It is transposed
up one octave as is usual for the recorder,
and also up one semitone into A minor.
If it is played on \f2A 415\fP instruments,
then it will sound in concert Ab minor, as intended;
of course it may also be played on \f2A 440\fP instruments,
provided the very dark tonality of the original is borne in mind.

.LP
In the original, the passage between the fourth crochet in bar 30
and the beginning of bar 40 is notated in B minor.
This change in key signature does not seem
to signal any brighter mood,
so rather than write in B# minor,
I have left the key signature of this passage unchanged.
The original time signature is \f2CC\fP, which I have changed to 8/4.
