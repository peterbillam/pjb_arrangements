The three chorale preludes come from Johannes Brahms' last work,
\f2Eleven Chorale Preludes for Organ\fP, Op. 122, composed in 1896.
In a chorale prelude, the composer takes a known hymn tune
and weaves several contrapuntal voices around it.
The audience would be expected to recognise the hymn tune on
which it is based, and to know the text that it referred to;
this edition therefore includes settings of the tunes to
which the preludes refer.

The Lutheran approach to popular songs was more sophisticated
than that of the Calvinists; instead of forbidding them outright,
they wrote religious words to fit the tunes,
and forbade the singing of the old words.
Thus the earlier song \f2Innsbruck, ich muß dich lassen\fP
\s-1(Innsbruck, I must leave you)\s0 by Heinrich Isaac
became the hymn \f2O Welt, ich muss dich lassen\fP
\s-1(O world, I must leave you)\s0 with new words by Johannes Hesse.
In this form, it was harmonised ten seperate times by J.\ S.\ Bach;
the version offered here has three descant voices.

\f2O wie selig seid ihr doch, ihr Frommen\fP
was written as a hymn by Johann Crüger in 1649
to words by Simon Dach; again, this harmonisation is by Bach.
The text and melody of the carol \f2Es ist ein Ros entsprungen\fP
are from the sixteenth century; this famous setting is by Michael Praetorius.

Brahms' \f2Eleven Chorale Preludes Op 122\fP,
the culmination of his lifetime study of early music,
were his farewell to his craft and art.
They were written at Ischl, his country retreat,
shortly after the death of Clara Schumann,
and shortly before his own death of liver cancer.
Six of them were transcribed for piano by Busoni in 1902.
Number 3, \f2O Welt, ich muss dich lassen\fP, spacious and serene,
is reminiscent of the last movement of the \f2Deutsches Requiem\fP.
Number 6, \f2O wie selig seid ihr doch\fP,
which also refers to \f2Selig sind die Toten\fP in the \f2Requiem\fP,
is an paradisial unbroken pastoral 12/8.
The appeal of the tender number 8, \f2Es ist ein Ros entsprungen\fP,
is more harmonic.

These pieces let us marvel
at the depth and the unity of this unbroken tradition
which spans already from Isaac through Bach and Brahms to Busoni,
almost five hundred years.
