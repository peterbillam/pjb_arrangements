The three volumes of \f2Des Knaben Wunderhorn\fP
were published by Clemens Brentano and Achim von Arnim from 1805 to 1808.
They are a collection of folk-song texts
from the Middle Ages to the 18th century:
love songs, soldier songs, walking songs and songs for children.
The younger German Romantics adopted this collection
in their search for everything untainted by modern civilisation.

\f2Der Jungbrunnen (Märchen und Gedichte)\fP
was the first book by Paul von Heyse (1830 Berlin - 1914 Munich).
It was published anonymously in 1850, by Paul's father.
Paul Heyse is also the author of the tragedy \f2Francesca von Rimini\fP,
and of the collection of Italian folksongs \f2Italienisches Liederbuch\fP
later set to music by Hugo Wolf.
Heyse was friends with many artists and writers, including Theodor Storm,
Arnold Böcklin, Joseph Victor von Scheffel and Gottfried Keller.
By 1860 he was one of the most popular writers in Germany, and in 1910
became the first German author to win the Nobel prize for Literature.

These secular partsongs in four to six voices
were mostly composed around 1873-74,
though some probably date back to Brahms' Hamburg and Detmold days.
\f2Rosmarin\fP and \f2Von alten Liebesliedern\fP
use Brahms' folksong-setting manner in a more sophisticated idiom.
\f2Es geht ein Wehen\fP exists in a very similar version from around 1860.
The Old-German folksong \f2Vergangen ist mir Glück und Heil\fP
also exists as a song, Op.48 no.6.
.\" (Likewise, \f2Ich schwing mein Horn\fP exists
.\" both as a solo song and as a male chorus.)
.Lp
Most of the other numbers make use of the canonic methods Brahms had
perfected in his earlier choral pieces, but these are now more smoothly
woven into the flow of the music,
especially in the madrigal-like \f2All meine Herzgedanken\fP,
where multiple imitation builds up the texture
to a full six parts, antiphonally divided between men and women.
Particularly fine is \f2Waldesnacht\fP,
one of the most evocative Romantic choral works,
where the canonic writing is an atmospheric play of light and shade,
in a wistful mood of union with nature.

.Lp
For typesetting reasons, hairpins have been written out as
\  \f2cresc . . . dim . . .\fP

I first heard these songs in a beautiful
recording by the \f2Leipziger Rundfunkchor\fP,
now, apparently, no longer available,
but still the most musical choral singing I've ever heard.
\  I dedicate this edition to the old \f2Leipziger Rundfunkchor\fP !
