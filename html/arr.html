<A NAME="bwv226_rec"><B>Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf</B></A>
by J. S. Bach, arranged for SATB-SATB recorders, 2006.
</P><P>
The thrilling, jubilant eight-voice counterpoint
of the first movement of this motet,
the firm, articulate and vigorous Allabreve fugue,
and the supple and sonorous final chorale make this
a most exciting piece for the recorder ensemble.</P>

<A NAME="satb_chorales"><B>Forty Chorales</B></A>
by J. S. Bach, arranged for piano, 2006.
</P><P>
It is the chorales (not his trademark fugues),
at the frontier between voice-leading and harmony,
that lie at the heart of Bach's technique.
The SATB-chorales BWV's 26, 262, 104, 4, 274, 121, 288, 18, 303,
43, 145, 306, 155, 310, 60, 32, 315, 318, 330, 371, 228, 376, 245, 378,
382, 386, 387, 307, 62, 390, 396, 400, 402, 394, 180, 413, 414, 248,
437 and 178, are offered here laid out for keyboard.
They include the chromaticism of <I>Es ist genug</I>
which will reappear in Berg's violin concerto,
the extravagant voice-crossings in <I>Christum wir sollen loben schon</I>,
the two-and-a-half-bar phrases of <I>Schm&uuml;cke dich, o liebe Seele</I>,
the lovely tune and fluent bass of <I>Sollt ich meinem Gott nicht singen</I>,
and much else.
</P><P>
These chorales can be used for a variety of musicianship exercises,
such as keyboard sight-reading practice,
singing one voice and playing the other three, and so on.</P>

<A NAME="bwv582"><B>Passacaglia and Fugue in c minor</B></A>
by J. S. Bach, arranged for piano four hands, 2002.</P>
<P>The <I>Passacaglia and Fugue</I>, BWV 582,
is one of the first fruits of Bach's early mastery, which sythesises
its models, Buxtehude, Reinken, and the French style, but far surpasses
them in dramatic intensity, in vigour, in its ability to affect and excite.
It is a summit of the organ repertoire, but there is also an
important tradition of playing it on stringed keyboard instruments.
The manuscript was apparently headed <I>Cembalo e pedale</I>;
such instruments are rare these days, but Bach possessed three of them.
The american organist E. Power Biggs has recorded the piece on a harpsichord
with pedals, and suggests "The music seems equally at home in the sonority
of strings or pipes, and it assumes a different individuality in each".
</P><P>
The aim of this arrangement for piano four hands
is to make it as practical to sight-read as possible,
to minimise the time spent in working out details.
The typical four-part texture is shared with two parts to each player,
some thought has been given to feasible page turns,
some registration decisions, such as adding octaves, have been made,
and conflicts between parts have been resolved.

<A NAME="bwv655"><B>Trio super Herr Jesu Christ, dich zu uns wend</B></A>
by J. S. Bach, arranged for flute and piano, 2003.</P>
<P>
Number 5 of the <I>Great Eighteen Chorales</I> is a trio on the hymn-tune
<I>Herr Jesu Christ, dich zu uns wend</I>, BWV 655.
It fits particularly well onto flute and piano.
The top two voices share the same register, and frequently cross,
so they need different tone-colours. For practical performance,
a separate piano part is supplied with a convenient page turn,
and Bach's SATB setting of the hymn (BWV 332) is included.

<A NAME="thron_kbd"><B>Vor deinen Thron tret' ich hiermit</B></A>
by J. S. Bach, arranged for piano, 2001.</P>
<P>Bach's final composition, the organ chorale prelude BWV668a,
was dictated from his death-bed to his pupil and son-in-law Altnikol.
It is offered here in a new edition, arranged for piano.
The intensely clear personal expression arising from
the assumption of difficult technical constraints,
the modesty, and yet also the exploit,
of composing with only Martin Luther's notes,
the wonderful beauty of the piece
and the personal circumstances under which it was written,
combine to make this chorale prelude one of the greatest
achievements of the western musical tradition.

<B>J. S. Bach, Fugue for SATB recorders, BWV 689</B></A>, 2000.</P>
<P>In the 3rd book of J. S. Bach's Clavier&uuml;bungen,
just after the Chorale Preludes
<A HREF="#bwv802345">and before the 4 Duets</A>,
there is this Fugue,
on the same hymn-tune subject as the previous chorale prelude,
marked <I>Fuga super: Jesus Christus unser Heiland. a 4. Manualiter</I>.
It's a lovely fugue, flowing and sonorous, full of gravitas.
Here it is transposed from f minor into g minor.

from the <I>Clavier&uuml;bungen Dritter Theil</I>,
by J. S. Bach, for keyboard, 2012.</P>
<P>
The third book of J. S. Bach's Clavier&uuml;bungen was published in 1739.
It contains twenty-seven pieces. Just after the Chorale Preludes and
before the final Fugue, there are four Duets, BWV802, BWV803, BWV804 and
BWV805. They are not necessarily for organ; they are just as at home on any
keyboard, however, they are mostly known to organists. They are, basically,
two-part inventions; but they were written nearly twenty years after the
<I>Inventions</I>, and are bigger and musically more ambitious. They
are published here because they deserve to become as well known to all
keyboard players as the earlier <I>Two-part Inventions</I> already are.

from the first book of the <I>Well-Tempered Clavier</I>,

<BR>
The fingering is based on Czerny's, which has great historical importance
and is an amazing source of insightful solutions to intractable problems.
Here it has evolved to make more use of 4-over-5,
and of sliding from a black note down to a neighbouring white note.
This fingering should be useful to newcomers to the
<I>Wohltemperierte Klavier</I>;
it can be safely adopted as a first suggestion,
then gradually adjusted as desired.

No-one but Bach has written such rich music for the solo line.

<P>This is the great six-voice fugue from Bach's <I>Musical Offering</I>,
arranged for two pianos.
J. S. Bach himself did not specify any instrumentation, but his son Carl
Philipp Emmanuel declared the fugue was intended as keyboard music.
On one keyboard the voices cross a great deal and tend to lose their
identities. This new arrangement divides the voices alternately
between the keyboards; each keyboard ends up with what seems like a
spare but beautiful 3-voice fugue, and yet they fit together in an
astonishing six-voice texture which is one of the great achievements
of the western musical tradition.</P>

J. S. Bach, Contrapunctus 14, from the Art of Fugue,
completed by D. F. Tovey</B></A>
arranged for keyboard, 1998.</P>
<P>This is the final fugue from Bach's <I>Art of Fugue</I>, as completed by
D. F. Tovey, the English pianist and composer who died in 1940.
As Bach left Contrapunctus 14 when he died, it is a triple fugue,
but none of the three subjects is the theme of the <I>Art of Fugue</I>.
In 1880, Gustav Nottebohm pointed out that that theme,
with one small rhythmic adjustment,
fits in counterpoint with the other three subjects.
This made it clear that the fugue had been intended by Bach as a quadruple
fugue with the theme of the <I>Art of Fugue</I> as the fourth subject,
and there have since been several attempts to complete the fugue on this basis.
Tovey's completion is of great historical interest,
and was previously only been available on C clefs in open score.</P>

Ecossaise). For four hands, most of these pieces become technically
very easy, in fact some of the Ecossaises could serve as first pieces.

offer a solid rhythm, a variety of moods and key-signatures, and a joy
of music-making which are hard to match.

There are also sets for the Viola de Gamba (1728) and for the Violin (1735),

the Telemann Fantasias would be the summit of the repertoire for the solo line.
The Flute Fantasias are offered here in a new edition for recorder.

by using descant fingering, and this may well be the preferred approach
