Thomas Tallis' forty-voice motet \f2Spem in alium\fP
is not the first attempt at the many-voice extreme of choral music,
but it is particularly fluent, and beautifully shaped and paced.

.Lp
Its half-a-dozen comrades include:
the thirty-six-part \f2Deo gratias\fP believed to be by Ockeghem (1430-1495),
the twenty-four-part \f2Qui habitat in adiutorio\fP by Josquin (1450-1521),
the nineteen-part \f2O bone Jesu\fP by Robert Carver (1487-1546)
then our forty-voice \f2Spem in alium\fP by Thomas Tallis (1505-1585),
the forty-part \f2Ecce beatum lucem\fP by Alessandro Striggio (1536-1592)
and also his \f2Missa sopre ecco si beato giorno\fP
which is mostly for forty voices but includes a sixty-voice \f2Agnus Dei\fP;
then the relatively modest nineteen-part
\f2Buccinatae in neomenia\fP by Giovanni Gabrielli (1536-1612),
and the fifty-four part \f2Missa Salisburgensis\fP
thought to be by Biber (1644-1704).

.Lp
Some of these are largely chordal (Striggio, Gabrielli, Biber),
and the rest are heavily polyphonic (Josquin, Ockeghem, Carver).
Tallis uses both possibilities,
beginning with polyphony, using homophony for
'Domine deus, creator caeli et terrae',
and finishing again with forty-part counterpoint.

.Lp
Striggio was in London in 1567,
and probably had with him the score of his \f2Ecce beatum lucem\fP,
so Tallis may well have seen this score, and been impressed by it.
\f2Ecce beatum lucem\fP was first performed in Bavaria in 1568,
and \f2Spem in alium\fP was probably first performed in 1570 or 1571,
in the Long Gallery of Arundel House,
between the Strand and the Thames in London.
