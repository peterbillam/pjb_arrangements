Scriabin studied composition under Georges Conyus from 1883.
Georges Conyus had devised a neat method of rhythmic and metric analysis :
\f2Le diagnose metrotectonique de la forme des organismes musicaux\fP
which, much later in 1933, was published as a book.
As Kelkel points out,
Scriabin's pieces are particularly clearly shaped,
when looked at with Conyus' method.

Scriabin also used palindromic (non-retrogradable) rhythms,
and also many forms of augmentation or diminution,
such as addition or subtraction of the dot
or long/short inversion,
which were later used by Messiaen.

No. 4 has the old Minnes√§nger form of the \f2Bar\fP,
as explained by \f2David\fP in Act I Scene 3 and Act III Scene 2
of the \f2Meistersinger\fP.
It can also be seen as spun by repeating the last 6, 3, or 2 beats,
somewhat varied (usually upwards),
in a classical condensation and liquidation;
then the recapitulation with written-out ritardandi.

Editions

In this edition the notes are right but many expression marks are not,
partly through the constraints of my music-typesetting software \f2muscript\fP.
Long slurs have been omitted, and the arpeggiation symbols are missing.
If you're considering playing these pieces,
make sure you consult a more authoritative edition.

Op.74 is not included in the Peters Edition \f2Band III Preludes and Poems\fP
edited by Gunther Philipp.

In the 1967 \f2Muzyka\fP edition, reprinted by \f2Dover\fP in 1973,
there seem to be misprints in:
 no.1 bar 2, RH top voice 2nd-last note should be an e#, not an e
 no.4 bar 9, LH third triplet-quarter should surely be a gb, not a g
 no.5 bar 3, RH last note c# should be tied over to the first note of bar 4
 no.5 bar 13, LH middle phrase, the first of the tied chords should be <G_ G> not <G_ E>
