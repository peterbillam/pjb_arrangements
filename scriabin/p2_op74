\f3\s+8Five Preludes, \  Alexander Scriabin op.74, 1914\s0\fP
.sp 1.4c

The following analysis is largely distilled from Manfred Kelkel's book
\f2Alexandre Scriabine:
Sa vie, l'ésotérisme et le langage musical dans son oeuvre\fP,
Éditions Honoré Champion, 7 quai Malaquais, Paris, 1978.
Kelkel's analysis seems to me investigative and insightful;
previous analyses seem more procrustean.

Scriabin's Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, and Ten-note scales
.LP
.nh
Danilewitsch quotes Scriabin:
"my melody is a decomposed harmony, and my harmony is condensed melody."
The harmony notes are not a subset, selected for lower tension,
of the melody notes; they are all of them.
The euphony desirable in longer notes is attained by careful spacing;
this in turn encourages some arpeggiation in performance,
which further blurs the border between the harmonic and melodic realms.
In the following they're called scales,
but they could also be called chords.

\f3The Six-note scales :\fP (op.60 ...) \ 
Scriabin uses two kinds of six-note scale:
one derived from a whole-tone scale by raising one of the notes,
i.e. 2+2+2+3+1+2 semitones;
the second by also lowering the opposite note (three away) from
the raised one, i.e. 1+3+2+3+1+2.
I will call them \f36A\fP and \f36B\fP respectively.
.LP
.nh
\f3The Seven-note scales :\fP (op.62 ...) \ 
Scriabin uses two kinds of seven-note scale:
one derived from a whole-tone scale by splitting one of the notes into two,
i.e. 2+2+2+1+2+1+2 semitones;
the second by also lowering the opposite note (three away) from
the split one, i.e. 1+3+2+1+2+1+2.
I will call them \f37A\fP and \f37B\fP respectively.
.LP
.nh
\f3The Eight-note scale :\fP (op.55, 64...) \ 
Scriabin used the scale 1+2+1+2+1+2+1+2 semitones,
which repeats every three semitones,
has only three distinct transpositions
and was later adopted by Messiaen.
The eight-note chord \f2D# E F# G A Bb c db\fP,
for example, I will call \f38\ (D#,E)\fP.
In op.74 nos.3 and 5 the eight-note chord is used to end a section.
.LP
.nh
\f3The Nine-note scales :\fP (op.67 ...) \  
Scriabin uses two, perhaps three kinds of nine-note scale:
one derived from the eight-note scale by adding one of the missing notes,
i.e. 1+2+1+2+1+1+1+1+2, which has twelve transpositions;
the second using 2+1+1+2+1+1+2+1+1 semitones
which repeats every four semitones
and has only four distinct transpositions
and was later adopted by Messiaen;
the third with the lower half-octave in tones
and the upper completely chromatic
i.e. 2+2+2+1+1+1+1+1+1.
I will call them \f39A\fP, \f39B\fP and \f39C\fP respectively.
.LP
.nh
\f3The Ten-note scales :\fP (op.74) \ 
Scriabin uses two kinds of ten-note scale:
one in which the missing notes are three semitones apart,
i.e. 1+2+1+2+1+1+1+1+1+1
which has a lower half-octave with an eight-note character
but an upper half which is completely chromatic;
the other in which the missing notes are six semitones apart,
i.e. 1+2+1+1+1+1+2+1+1+1 which repeats every six
semitones and has only six distinct transpositions.
I will call them \f310A\fP and \f310B\fP respectively.
