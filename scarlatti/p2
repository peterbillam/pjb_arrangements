\f3\s+5Six Preludes and Fugues from Book One\s0\fP

Prelude in C major
is the entrance door
It also "happens to" contain all twelve semitone pitches,
thus announcing the plan of the whole WTC.
Fugue I stretti

Fugue in d-minor inversions

Fugue in A-flat somewhere between serene and jubilant;
very plain, even naive harmony,
what Schweizer identifies as the confident steps of the pilgrim,
joyful running scales.
They peal and chime.
I like Czerny's suggested tempo of 60 quarters per minute.
