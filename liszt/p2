These pieces have been controversial.
Peter Raabe in \f2Liszts Schaffen\fP 1931,
disparaged \f2Nuages gris\fP and \f2Unstern\fP
(first published in 1927),
as symptoms of a \f2Verfall musikalischer Kräfte\fP,
the decay of his musical powers.
.Lp
But then there was a flood of studies during the post-Webern-serialism years,
for example
Rene Leibowitz \f2Les Prophéties de Franz Liszt\fP 1951,
Humphrey Searle \f2The Music of Liszt\fP 1954,
Carl Dalhaus \f2Franz Liszt und die Vorgeschichte der neuen Musik\fP 1961,
W.M. Goode 1965, P.A. Pisk 1969, R.Ch. Lee 1970,
Dieter Rexroth \f2Zum Spätwerk Franz Liszts\fP 1970,
Peter Schwarz \f2Studien zur Orgelmusik Franz Liszts\fP 1973,
Harold A. Thompson \f2The Evolution of Whole-tone Sound in Liszt's Original Piano-works\fP 1974,
Serge Gut \f2Franz Liszt: Les Eléments du Langage Musical\fP 1975,
Dieter Torkewitz \f2Harmonisches Denken im Frühwerk Franz Liszts\fP 1978,
Norbert Nagler \f2Die verspätete Zukunftsmusik\fP 1980.
These studies mostly quoted Liszt's statement that his ambition as a
composer was to lance his javelin as far as possible into the future,
and mostly discussed Liszt's late work as atonal,
and the herald of serialism;
the proof, therefore, that serialism was the legitimate continuation
of the whole western art-music tradition.
.Lp
The opinion of the editor is that these pieces
are all gloomy pieces (just look at their titles),
and it would be unwise to adopt their harmonic palette
as the foundation for a whole style.
.Lp
Technically, they are easy to play;
only the quiet tremolandos are challenging.
But it's not because of a decay in Liszt's musical powers;
also the \f2Valse Oubliée\fP and \f2Czárdás Macabre\fP are from those years.
I think it's because he wanted to speak of senility, disease and death,
which will touch us all,
.\" not just the concert virtuosi among us;
and therefore he wanted to speak to us all.
.Lp
The harmonic palette if often
.\" based on
a sustained bare interval such as a fifth,
with tension increased by the moving voices,
mostly moving in narrow intervals,
coming  into semitone-dischords  with these bare-interval notes.
This gives rise to many chords such as fourth-plus-tritone,
which often recurr in the second Viennese school;
but there they are used as primary harmony
rather than a sustained consonance plus a discordant melodic voice.
The three consecutive whole-tones that end \f2Unstern\fP were also used
by Berg in his \f2Violinkonzert\fP (bar II/136),
where Berg credits them to Bach's \f2Es ist genug\fP.
.Lp
The  Fugue  on BACH is from an earlier time - the original for organ was
written in 1854, and the piano version in 1870;
nevertheless, 29 bars of the Fugue are included,
because of their great music-theoretic interest.
