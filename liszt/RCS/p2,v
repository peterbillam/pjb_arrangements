These pieces have been controversial.
Peter Raabe in \f2Liszts Schaffen\fP 1931,
disparaged \f2Nuages gris\fP and \f2Unstern\fP
(first published in 1927),
as symptoms of a \f2Verfall musikalischer Kräfte\fP.

But then there was a flood of studies during the post-Webern-serialism years,
for example
Rene Leibowitz \f2Les Prophéties de Franz Liszt\fP 1951,
Humphrey Searle \f2The Music of Liszt\fP 1954,
Carl Dalhaus \f2Franz Liszt und die Vorgeschichte der neuen Musik\fP 1961,
W.M. Goode 1965, P.A. Pisk 1969, R.Ch. Lee 1970,
Dieter Rexroth \f2Zum Spätwerk Franz Liszts\fP 1970,
Peter Schwarz \f2Studien zur Orgelmusik Franz Liszts\fP 1973,
Harold A. Thompson \f2The Evolution of Whole-tone Sound in Liszt's Original Piano-works\fP 1974,
Serge Gut \f2Franz Liszt: Les Eléments du Langage Musical\fP 1975,
Dieter Torkewitz \f2Harmonisches Denken im Frühwerk Franz Lizts\fP 1978,
Norbert Nagler \f2Die verspätete Zukunftsmusik\fP 1980.

These studies mostly quoted Liszt's statement that his ambition as a
composer was to lance his javelin as far as possible into the future
("\f2Ma seule ambition de musicien était et serait de lancer mon javelot
dans les espaces indéfinis de l'avenir\fP"),
and mostly discussed Liszt's late work as atonal,
and the herald of serialism;
the proof, therefore, that serialism was the legitimate continuation
of the whole western art-music tradition.

The opinion of the editor is that these pieces
are all gloomy pieces (just look at their titles),
and it would be unwise to adopt their harmonic palette
as the foundation for a whole style.

Technically, they are very easy to play, compared with most of Liszt;
only the low quiet tremolandos are challenging.
But I don't think that's because of a decay in Liszt's musical powers;
also the \f2Valse Oubliée\fP and \f2Czárdás Macabre\fP are from those years.
I think it's because he wanted to speak of senility, disease and death,
which will touch us all, not just the concert virtuosi among us;
and therefore he wanted to speak to us all.
.LP

The three consecutive whole-tones that end \f2Unstern\fP
were also used by Alban Berg in the chorale in the second movement
of his \f2Violinkonzert\fP (bar 136),
where Berg credits them to Bach's \f2Es ist genug\fP.
