The harmonic palette if often based on
a sustained bare interval such as a bare fifth,
with tension increased by the moving voices coming into
semitone-dischords with these bare-interval notes.
This does indeed give rise to many occurences of chords
such as fourth-plus-tritone.
These do indeed often recurr in the second Viennese school;
though there they are used as primary harmony,
rather than a sustained consonant interval and a discordant melodic voice.

The Fugue on BACH is from an earlier time -
the original for organ was written in 1854,
and Liszt's piano version dates from 1870.
Nevertheless, the first 29 bars of the Fugue are included here,
because of their great music-theoretic interest.
