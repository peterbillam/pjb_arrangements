In the days when the aristocracy patronised the art of music,
the richest and most musical employed their own orchestras and composers.
The high point of the musical calendar would occur when
travelling virtuosi would visit court,
talent-spotting or looking for employment,
giving lessons and concerts.
For such concerts, concerti grossi were written.
They give the orchestra the chance to swap phrases with top class soloists,
and to play along with them,
perhaps to impress them and so improve their career options.
.LP
Bach wrote six concerti grossi, the \f2Brandenburg Concerti\fP.
.LP
Ha\*:ndel wrote nineteen concerti grossi;
six in opus 4 published in 1734,
one known as \f2Alexander's Feast\fP composed in 1736,
and twelve in opus 6 published in 1739.
.LP
The original of opus 6 no 4 in A minor
is for string orchestra with two violin soloists.
This arrangement is for harpsichord and recorders;
it is designed to be conducted from the keyboard,
as would have been the practice at the time.
.LP
There are four contrasting movements;
the first a lyrical solo for Alto recorder
(the low E is played by half-shading the end-hole with the knee),
the second an dramatic display for multiple soprani,
the third serene sustained chords for SAT over a walking bass line,
and the fourth an energetic romp.
