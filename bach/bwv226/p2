Johann Sebastian Bach has bequeathed us six motets.
They were first published in 1803 by Breitkopf u. HÃ¤rtel
in an edition by Schicht, the Thomaskantor at the time.
The manuscripts of two of them survive, including that of
\f2Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf\fP,
and its parts are marked
\f2Motette bei Beerdigung des seel. Professoris und Rectoris Ernesti\fP,
who died in October 1729.
In the score a figured bass for organ is written out,
and the first choir is to be supported by strings,
and the second by oboes, \f2taille\fP (cor-anglais, roughly) and bassoon.

Several of the expressive motifs that Schweizer discusses make an
appearance, for example the
step-motif in \f2denn er vertritt\fP (e.g. in the alto at bar 178)
and the Joy-motif of \f2Heiligen\fP (e.g. in the tenor at 180).

This edition makes the motet available for recorders.
The words are mostly omitted,
but the ends of phrases, where breaths would usually be taken,
have been indicated with breath-marks.
Some implied legato has been made explicit with slurs,
though choirs do not always sing legato in extended passages on one vowel.
In general, quavers joined by beams should be slurred together,
according to the conventional notation of vocal music.
In the first movement the quavers Bb-A-Bb occur frequently;
there is an alternative fingering on the C-recorders which might be useful,
using half the right ring-finger, and the A played with the middle finger.
The Allabreve, in order to retain rhythmic vitality,
needs clear articulation of its phrases.

The thrilling, jubilant eight-voice counterpoint of the first movement
gradually merges to four-voice counterpoint during the course of the motet.
The basses unite in bars 132, the tenors in bar 134, the altos in 136
and the the sopranos finally in the Allabreve, bar 146.
This complicates the distribution of Parts:
