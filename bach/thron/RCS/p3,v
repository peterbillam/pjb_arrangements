The chorale prelude is deeply connected to humanity.
The voices lie within the ranges of a choir,
the natural tempo of 72 quavers per minute refers to the human heart,
and at the flow of nine bars per minute each bar coincides with
the full breath in and out at deep rest;
both these values were codified as the \f2Integer Valor\fP of the Middle Ages.

The intensely clear personal expression arising from
the assumption of difficult technical constraints,
the modesty, and yet also the exploit,
of composing with only Martin Luther's notes,
the wonderful beauty of the piece
and the personal circumstances under which it was written,
combine to make this chorale prelude one of the greatest
achievements of the western musical tradition.

It is offered here in a new edition, arranged for piano.
The source was the first Bachgesellschaft edition,
as reprinted by Dover in \f2Johann Sebastian Bach - Organ Music\fP.
The phrasing and emphasis of all voices should accord to the text.
The chorale melody (entering at bars 8, 19, 29 and 40)
should be stronger and more sustained than
the faster-moving contrapuntal voices.
As from 2013, fingering is provided.
There are two impractical stretches;
on the sixth quaver of bar 9,
a simple way is to take the bass F#, sustain it with the pedal,
play the tenor A as a dotted quaver,
and play the bass G by stretching the ninth;
on the fourth quaver of bar 10,
the simplest is to take the low D, sustain it with the pedal,
and play the F# as a semiquaver.
The long notes can be discreetly retaken, and preferably on the offbeats,
so that for example the final G of fourteen beats could be taken as
3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 beats.
Worth particular attention is the extraordinary beauty of the final cadence.
