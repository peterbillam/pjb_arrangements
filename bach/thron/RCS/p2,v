Some composers produce their best work in their youth,
and then either retire or deteriorate in old age;
others, such as Mozart, Beethoven or Schubert, improve steadily,
and their late works are their greatest.
Johann Sebastian Bach is the most extraordinary example.
In March and April of 1750 he had undergone two "eye operations",
whatever that meant in 1750,
and by July he was on his death bed, where he dictated his last composition
to his pupil and son-in-law Johann Christoph Altnikol.
It is a chorale prelude for organ, BWV668,
on a hymn tune written by Martin Luther himself.
Most of the old hymn tunes have more than one set of words,
and this one has two\ :

.QP

\f2Wenn wir in höchsten Nöten sein
und wissen nicht, wo aus noch ein,
und finden weder Hülf noch Rat,
ob wir gleich sorgen früh und spat:
so ist dies unser Trost allein,
daß wir zusammen allgemein
dich anrufen, o treuer Gott,
um Rettung aus der Angst und Not.\fP

.QP
.nf
\f2Vor deinen Thron tret' ich hiermit,
o Gott und dich demütig bitt:
wend' dein genädig angesicht
vor mir betrübtem Sünder nicht.\fP

.LP

Both hymns are appropriate to the approach of death;
but the first sings of deepest distress,
and the second of something far more glorious.
So Luther's tune itself is ambiguous; it could refer to either set of words.
In any chorale prelude the hymn-tune is woven into counterpoint with
faster-moving motifs in other voices,
and in this particularly strict counterpoint
Bach constrains himself to taking these motifs
from speeded-up phrases from the hymn-tune itself;
so every note here stems from Martin Luther.
However, the phrases that Bach has chosen for his motifs
only fit one of the sets of words,
namely \f2Vor deinen Thron tret' ich hiermit\fP.
The moment of death can be seen as painful, or as glorious;
by his choice of notes Bach makes clear his point of view.
