In 1991 a theory was published by Zoltán Göncz answering the question of
how Bach planned the appearance of the fourth subject, the main subject
of the cycle:

In the course of the exposition of the first three subjects (first
subject: mm. 1–21, second subject: mm. 114–141, third subject:
mm. 193–207), Bach applied a serial sequence of voice entries decided
in advance, by which he determined the space and time parameters of the
subject entries. The superimposition of the three exposition matrices
foreshadows, and develops as a negative, the sequence of the voice entries
of the fourth subject. The copying of the four subjects onto each other
displays a characteristic construction of Bach's oeuvre occurring mainly
in the vocal fugues: that of the permutation fugue.

The discovery of the permutation matrix was one of the most essential
requirements for achieving a reconstruction of Contrapunctus XIV which
might approach the original form planned by Bach.[13][14]
