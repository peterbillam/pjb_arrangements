\f3\s+5Flute Sonata BWV 1032\s0\fP
.sp 1.2c
.LP
Johann Sebastian Bach has left us
three flute sonatas with obbligato keyboard parts.
There are also two or three flute sonatas with continuo accompaniments;
the authenticity of one of these is contested.

In writing the Sonata in A, BWV1032, Bach respects the range of the recorder.
Owners of a Voice Flute,
which is a recorder between the Tenor and Alto, whose lowest note is D,
may play the sonata in its original form without changing a single note.
Owners of the Alto recorder may transpose the sonata up three semitones
into C major, which is a common procedure;
for the keyboard player, however, transposing at sight is not so easy.
Therefore this arrangement makes the sonata available in C major,
and adds a major work to the recorder repetoire.

The manuscript of the Sonata in A
is titled \f2Sonata a 1 Traversa è Cembalo obligato di J. S. Bach\fP
in Bach's handwriting.
It was discovered by von Winterfeld in an antique shop in Breslau
and presented to the \f2Preuß. Staatsbibliotek\fP in Berlin;
during the second world war it was moved
to the monastery of Grüssau in central Silesia.
At the end of the war, it was removed by the Polish government
to the Jagiellon University in Cracow,
and in 1977 was presented to the \f2Deutsche Staatsbibliotek\fP in Berlin.
The manuscript is written on nineteen staves, and apart from
this sonata it also contains a concerto for two keyboards and string orchestra.
The concerto occupies the top sixteen staves on each page,
and, with typical economy, the Sonata fills up the lowest three staves.
Eight of the manuscript pages are intact,
but unfortunately, on six of the pages the lowest part has been cut away,
so that we lack some forty-five bars at the end of the first movement.

.LP
.nh
Completions of the first movement have been published by
Gustav Schreck (Peters),
Georges Barrère (Boston),
Alfred Dürr (Baerenreiter),
William Bennet (?)
and Bart Kuijken (Breitkopf u. Haertel).
The copyright status of these completions being unclear,
this edition provides a new completion by Peter Billam;
it extends from bar 63 to 88.
