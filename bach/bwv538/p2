\f3\s+5Four Duets, from the Clavierübungen Dritter Theil\s0\fP
.sp 1.4c
.Lp
The third book of J. S. Bach's Clavierübungen was published in 1739.
It contains twenty-seven pieces.
Just after the Chorale Preludes and before the final Fugue,
there are four Duets,
\s-1BWV\s0802, \s-1BWV\s0803, \s-1BWV\s0804 and \s-1BWV\s0805.

.Lp
They are not necessarily for organ;
they are just as at home on any keyboard,
however, they are mostly known to organists.
They are, basically, two-part inventions;
but they were written nearly twenty years after the
\f2Inventions\fP,
and are bigger and musically more ambitious.

.Lp
The Four Duets seem oddly placed within the \f2Clavierübungen Dritter Theil\fP,
where the other pieces are all for organ and have religious themes.
It would seem unworthy for Bach to have put them in just to make
up the number of pieces to 27 (i.e. three cubed),
but no very convincing explanation is known.

.Lp
They might represent the four daily prayers:
morning, evening, before the meal, and after the meal.
But the Duets do not seem convincingly characterised
as morning, evening and so on.
Anton Heiller suggested they might represent four elements:
heaven, air, water, and earth.
But how this fits in to the \f2Clavierübungen Dritter Theil\fP is not clear,
and, again, they are not convincingly so characterised;
for comparison, the variations 2,3,4,5 of the last movement of Beethoven's
Op 109 are very clearly air, fire, water and earth.
In any case, the Duets are Bach's addition to his
output of Two-part Inventions.

.Lp
In the Bach-Gesellschaft edition,
the trills are marked with individual symbols
as described in \f2Clavierbüchlein für Wilhelm Friedeman Bach\fP
(in the section \f2Explication unterschiedlicher Zeichen\fP),
but because of limitations of my typesetting-software \f2muscript\fP,
the trills are all homogenised here to a \f4tr\fP symbol.

.Lp
Roslyn Tureck has recorded these Duets on the piano.
They are published here
because they deserve to become as well known to all keyboard players
as the earlier Two-part Inventions already are.
