\f3\s+5Four Duets, from the Clavierübungen Dritter Theil\s0\fP
.sp 1.2c
.Lp
The third book of J. S. Bach's Clavierübungen was published in 1739.
It contains twenty-seven pieces.
Just after the Chorale Preludes and before the final Fugue,
there are four Duets,
\s-1BWV\s0802, \s-1BWV\s0803, \s-1BWV\s0804 and \s-1BWV\s0805.

.Lp
They are, basically, Two-part Inventions.
Unlike the rest of the \f2Clavierübungen Dritter Theil\fP
are not necessarily for organ; they are just as at home on any keyboard.
However, they are mostly known to organists.
They were written nearly twenty years after the Inventions,
and are musically far larger, more complex and more demanding.

.Lp
The Four Duets seem oddly placed within the \f2Clavierübungen Dritter Theil\fP.
It would be unworthy of Bach to have put them in just to make
up the number of pieces to 27 (i.e. three cubed),
but no very convincing explanation is known.

.Lp
Anton Heiller suggested they might represent four elements:
heaven, air, water, and earth.
But how this fits in to the \f2Clavierübungen Dritter Theil\fP is not clear.
Also they are not convincingly so characterised;
compare, for example,
the variations 1\-4 in Beethoven's Opus 110, second movement.

.Lp
They might also represent the four daily prayers:
morning, evening, before the meal, after the meal.
This seems more plausible,
since the preceding Chorale Preludes are each present
in two versions,
a long complex version and a simpler version without pedals,
corresponding to the existence in Lutheran theology
of two answers to each question,
one long and complex for the theologians,
and one short and simple for the congregation.
In this context, the four daily prayers would extend the range
of the \f2Clavierübungen Dritter Theil\fP
beyond the congregation to the town, to daily life itself.
But again, the Duets do not seem convincingly characterised
as morning, evening and so on.

.Lp
\f2Duetto I\fP
the little alternating canon in waves at bars 17-21

.Lp
These Duets are published here
because they deserve to become as well known to
all keyboard players as the Two-part Inventions are.
