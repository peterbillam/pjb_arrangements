\f3\s+5Six Preludes and Fugues from Book One\s0\fP
.sp 1.4c
.Lp
The Prelude in C major is the start of the journey.
It could hardly be easier to play or more inviting.
It also "happens to" contain all twelve semitone pitches,
thus announcing the plan of the whole WTC.
.br
The fugue has no significant counter-subject,
and is a display of \f2stretti\fP,
an anthem in praise of Craft.

.Lp
Prelude in A-flat major \f2Freudenmotiv\fP
.br
Fugue in A-flat somewhere between serene and jubilant;
very plain, even naive harmony,
what Schweizer identifies as the confident steps of the pilgrim,
joyful running scales.
They peal and chime.
I like Czerny's suggested tempo of 60 quarters per minute.

.Lp
The fingering is based on Czerny's,
which has immense historical importance and is a great source of
clever, insightful solutions to intractable problems.
Here it has evolved to make more use of four-over-five,
and to allow sliding from a black note down to a neighbouring white note.
Newcomers to these pieces should feel free to take it as a first suggestion,
which they may gradually change, detail by detail.
