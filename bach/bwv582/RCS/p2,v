\f3\s+9Passacaglia and Fugue in c minor\s-9\fP
.sp 0.9c
.Lp
The \f2Passacaglia et Thema Fugatum\fP in c minor, BWV 582,
is one of the first fruits of Bach's early mastery.
Probably written at Arnstadt, where Bach was from 1703 to 1708,
it sythensises its models, Buxtehude, Reinken, and the French style,
but far surpasses them in dramatic intensity,
in its ability to affect and excite.

.Lp
Johann Sebastian Bach was appointed in 1703 as organist
of the new Wender organ in the \f2Neue Kirche\fP
(now called the \f2Bachkirche\fP),
giving him for the first time in his life
free access to a fine modern organ.
It would have been tuned at about A\ =\ 465,
a semitone above modern conecrt pitch,
probably in Werckmeister temperament.

.Lp
The passacaglia owes debts to Buxtehude's ostinato works,
notably to his Passacaglia in d minor BuxWV 161.
In mid-October 1705 Bach walked the 400 kilometers from Arnstadt to Lübeck
to visit Buxtehude;
he stayed sixteen weeks, probably returning during January 1706.
As he only had permission for four weeks,
the prolonged absence, particularly over the busy season,
did cause him problems on his return.
It is not known whether Bach took his Passacaglia to Lübeck
as part of a portfolio, or wrote it afterwards as he absorbed his experience.
There are twenty variations.
The cantus firmus moves to the soprano voice in bar 88, becomes florid
at bar 104, dissolves at bar 112 and returns in triumph at bar 128.

.Lp
For the fugue, the passacaglia theme is divided into two halves,
the first half of which enters in the alto,
and the second of which, set in quavers, is its contersubject in the tenor.
The fugue borrows Reinken's "permutation fugue" idea, in which
each voice enters with the same series of subjects and countersubjects.
So when the soprano enters in g minor in bar 174,
the alto moves to the first countersubject in quavers,
the tenor to a second countersubject in semiquavers;
when the bass enters in c minor in bar 181,
the tenor becomes free counterpoint;
and the voices rotate themes again in bars 186 (g\ minor) and 192 (c\ minor).

.Lp
The aim of this arrangement for piano four hands
is to make this music available to piano players.
The typical four-part texture is shared with two parts to each player;
this divides the organ manual parts between the two players.
Some registration decisions, such as adding octaves, have been made,
and conflicts between parts have been resolved.
