\f3\s+9Passacaglia and Fugue in c minor\s-9\fP
.sp 2.4c
.Lp
The \f2Passacaglia et Thema Fugatum\fP in c minor, BWV 582,
is one of the first fruits of Bach's early mastery.
Probably written at Arnstadt, where Bach was from 1703 to 1708,
it sythesises its models, Buxtehude, Reinken, and the French style,
but far surpasses them in dramatic intensity, in vigour,
in its ability to affect and excite.

.Lp
Johann Sebastian Bach was appointed in 1703 as organist
of the new Wender organ in the \f2Neue\ Kirche\fP
(now called the \f2Bachkirche\fP),
giving him for the first time in his life
free access to a fine modern organ.
It would have been tuned at about A\ =\ 465,
a semitone above modern concert pitch,
probably in Werckmeister temperament.

.Lp
The passacaglia owes debts to Buxtehude's ostinato works,
notably to his Passacaglia in d\ minor BuxWV\ 161.
In mid-October\ 1705 Bach walked the 400 kilometers from Arnstadt to Lübeck
to visit Buxtehude, then 68 years old;
he only had permission to be absent for four weeks,
but he stayed sixteen weeks, probably returning during January\ 1706.
Probably Bach wrote his Passacaglia and Fugue afterwards,
as he absorbed his experience.
The Passacaglia has twenty variations.
The cantus firmus moves to the soprano voice in bar\ 88, becomes florid
at bar\ 104, dissolves at bar\ 112 and returns in triumph at bar\ 128.

.Lp
For the fugue, the passacaglia theme is divided into two halves,
the first half of which enters in the alto,
and the second of which, set in quavers, is its contersubject in the tenor.
The fugue borrows Reinken's "permutation fugue" idea, in which
each voice enters with the same series of subjects and countersubjects.
So when the soprano enters in g minor in bar 174,
the alto moves to the first countersubject in quavers
and the tenor to a second countersubject in semiquavers;
when the bass enters in c minor in bar 181,
the tenor becomes free counterpoint.
The voices rotate themes again at bar 186 in g\ minor and bar 192 in c\ minor.
