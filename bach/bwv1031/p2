\f3\s+5Flute Sonata \s-1BWV\s+1 1031\s-5\fP

Johann Sebastian Bach has left us
three flute sonatas with obbligato keyboard parts:
the great sonata in B minor \s-1BWV\s0 1030
(available in  C minor for alto recorder from Universal Edition 18748),
this sonata in Eb major \s-1BWV\s0 1031,
and the sonata in A major \s-1BWV\s0 1032
(available in C major for alto recorder from \f2www.pjb.com.au\fP).

The manuscript of the Sonata in Eb
is a copy from C.P.E. Bach's collection, titled
\f2Es\ d.\ Trio\ /\ Fürs obligate Clavier u. die Flöte / Von J. S. Bach\fP
in C.P.E. Bach's handwriting.
But its authenticity was contested by Friedrich Blume who
considered it too "galant",
said that it was "sicher nicht von Bach",
and excluded it from the \f2Neue Bach-Ausgabe\fP,
and hence from editions derived from that.
Details of this episode are given in Robert Marshall's
essay "The Compositions for Solo Flute:
A Reconsideration of their Authenticity and Chronology",
from his collection of essays "The Music of J. S. Bach",
in which Marshall argues for the sonata's restoration to the canon.
In the judgement of the arranger, this sonata is certainly by J.S. Bach.
It is simply too good to have been written by anybody else.
It is \f2galant\fP because he was writing a flute sonata;
it is no more \f2galant\fP than the organ Trio Sonatas,
or the Brandenburg Concerti.

Recorder players have several ways of playing this sonata.
On a Voice Flute it can be played up one semitone in E major,
and a harpsichordist should also be able
to perform this transposition at sight from a standard edition in Eb;
alternatively,
a Voice Flute at A\ 415 would allow a harpsichord at A\ 440
to read directly in Eb.
On a Tenor recorder it can be played down one semitone in D major,
or a Tenor recorder at A\ 440 would allow a harpsichord at A\ 415
to read directly in Eb.

The Alto recorder usually plays transverse flute repertoire
by transposing up three semitones;
however, the key of Gb is impractical,
and this arrangement makes the sonata available
transposed up four semitones into G major.
In this key, the keyboard part lies high.
The highest note is \f2f\fP in bar 125 of the final \f2Allegro\fP,
which will inconvenience harpsichordists;
but it occurs in this bar only.
If a piano is being used, the high key 
brings a lightness to the sound which suits the recorder well.
This edition adds an important piece to the repertoire of the alto recorder.
