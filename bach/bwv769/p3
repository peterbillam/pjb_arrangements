The Canonic Variations present, almost systematically,
most of the devices of musical rhetoric,
as they were known and taught at the time.
A partial list is presented here,
as gleaned from Burmeister, Walther, Mattheson and Lausberg.
These terms should probably be more widely known than they are,
because the effect of these devices is not limited to a
particular harmonic or rhythmic style.
