Lorentz Christof Mitzler (1711-1788)
studied keyboard and composition with Johann Sebastian Bach,
and in 1734 he dedicated to Bach his doctoral dissertation
\f2Quod musica ars sit pars eruditionis philosophicae\fP
(Music is part of a philosophical education).
In 1736 he was appointed to lecture in Mathematics, Music and Philosophy
at Leipzig University,
and started publishing his own journal \f2Musikalische Bibliotek\fP.
.LP

In 1738 he founded the \f2Sozietät der musikalischen Wissenschaften\fP,
which attracted some impressive associates:
Telemann joined in 1740, and Haendel was made an honorary member in 1745.
In June 1747 Bach finally became the Society's fourteenth member,
submitting two specimen compositions as demonstrations of his 
learning: the Canonic Variations on \f2Von Himmel hoch da komm' ich her\fP
(\s-2BWV\s0769), and the \f2Canon triplex a 6 voc\fP.
After Bach died in 1750, the \f2Musikalische Bibliotek\fP
devoted an issue to him in 1754,
containing a Necrology which is Bach's earliest biographical material,
and a score of the \f2Canon triplex\fP.

The score of the \f2Canonische Veränderungen\fP exists in two versions.
As submitted to Mitzler's Society it is in open score (one voice to each stave)
and with the canonic parts not written out,
but with only their entries indicated in the leading voice.
There is also a version in short score, for organists,
with the canons written out in full.
The order of the movements is different in the two scores;
this edition follows the short-score order.
In the open-score version Variation V is placed in the centre,
so that the piece ends with the canon by augmentation
(here called Variation IV).
Wilfred Mellers discusses the arguments for each order, and concludes
"Bach may have considered the two versions equally valid,
for different reasons."

Bach seems to have turned more and more to canons
as a touchstone for musical technique,
e.g. in the Musical Offering or the Art of Fugue.
The systematic writing of canons at different intervals,
and with inversion and augmentation, seems unique to Bach.
