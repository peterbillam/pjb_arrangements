\f3\s+9Trio super Herr Jesu Christ, dich zu uns wend\s-9\fP
.sp 2.0c
.Lp
Johann Sebastian Bach probably wrote the \f2Great Eighteen Chorales\fP,
soon after 1708, when he moved to Weimar.
He then revised them, during the years 1739-1742 and 1746-1747,
while he was in Leipzig, and they are sometimes known as the
\f2Eighteen Leipzig Chorales\fP.
Both versions can be seen in the \f2Bach-Gesellschaft\fP
edition, or reprinted in the \f2Dover\fP edition,
and they confirm Forkel's observation
"\f2comparing together many copies of his principal works,
written in different years, I confess that I have often felt
both surprise and delight at the means which he employed to make,
little by little, the faulty good,
the good better, and the better perfect \ .\ .\ .
Even commonplace passages are frequently changed into the most elegant
by changing, taking away, or adding a single note.\fP"

.Lp
Number 5 of the \f2Eighteen Chorales\fP is
a trio on the hymn-tune
\f2Herr Jesu Christ, dich zu uns wend\fP, BWV 655.
It fits particularly well onto flute and piano.
The top two voices share the same register, and frequently cross,
so they need different tone-colours.
Just a few beats in bars 50 and 51 need to be exchanged between voices;
if this arrangement is being played on violin and piano
the original in small notes can be played.
The running semiquaver scales are
Bach's characteristic motif expressing happiness,
as is the quaver rhythm in the bass, for example from bar 6 to bar 7.

.Lp
The flute trill in bar 62 should start from below,
starting with \f3d e f# e\fP.
For more practical performance,
a separate piano part is supplied, with a convenient page turn.
The piano fingering may be disregarded with a clear conscience.
Bach's SATB setting of the hymn is included.
