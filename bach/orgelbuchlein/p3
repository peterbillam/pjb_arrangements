10: In dulci jubilo

.LP
.nh
The continuous scalic movement is Bach's motif to represent
immediate, naïve joy.
The double canon at the octave is most impressive,
and the widening of the gap from one bar to two for the last line
is not only forced by the tune,
but also makes a spendid conclusion.
The two-against-three rhythm has been left in Bach's notation,
which is very clear to read as soon as you get used to it.

\f2In dulci jubilo
singet und seid froh,
unsers Herzens Wonne
liegt im praesipio,
leuchtet als die Sonne
Matris in gremio
Alpha es et O,
Alpha es et O.\fP
