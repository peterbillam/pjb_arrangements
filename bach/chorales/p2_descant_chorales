\f3\s+5Bach Chorales, for piano and melody instrument\s0\fP
.sp 1.1c

.Lp
It is the chorales, not his trademark fugues,
that lie at the heart of Bach's technique.
Wolff refers to Bach's \f2collection of 370 four-part
chorales that charted the course for tonal harmony.\fP
Donald Francis Tovey observes:
\f2Counterpoint, the art defined by Sir Frederick Gore Ouseley
as that of 'combining melodies'\. \. \.
This definition is not quite complete.
Classical couterpoint is the conveying of a mass of harmony
by means of a combination of melodies.
Thus the three melodies combined by Wagner in the Meistersinger prelude
do not make classical couterpoint,
for they require a mass of accompanying harmony to explain them.\fP

Forkel recounts, in Ernest Newman's translation:
\f2Bach began teaching composition not with dry counterpoint that led nowhere,
as was the way with other music teachers of his time\ ;\ .\ .\ .
He went immediately to pure four-part thorough-bass,
laying much stress on the setting-out of the voices,
since in this way the conception of the pure progression of the harmony
was made most intelligible.
From there he went to the chorale.
In these exercises he himself set the original bass,
and made his pupils add only the alto and the tenor.
Gradually he let them make the bass also.
Everywhere he insisted not only on the utmost purity of the
harmony in itself, but also on naturalness of progression
and a melodic flow of all the separate voices.\fP

.Lp
Bach, in other words, was exploring the frontier between voice-leading
and harmony; he worked out how voice-leading should be done
so as to give the impression of harmony.

.Lp
The chorales chosen here all use a melody instrument as a descant
above the SATB voices;
they come from his cantatas BWV's 12 31 85 136 161 and 172.
They are offered here for players of flute, oboe, and violin.
The vocal parts have been arranged for keyboard.
For ease of sight-reading, and with some regret,
crossed voices in the keyboard part have been uncrossed.
