\f3\s+5Forty Bach Chorales\s0\fP
.sp 0.8c

.Lp
It is the chorales, not his trademark fugues,
that lie at the heart of Bach's technique.
Wolff refers to Bach's \f2collection of 370 four-part
chorales that charted the course for tonal harmony.\fP
Donald Francis Tovey observes:
\f2Counterpoint, the art defined by Sir Frederick Gore Ouseley
as that of 'combining melodies'\. \. \.
This definition is not quite complete.
Classical counterpoint is the conveying of a mass of harmony
by means of a combination of melodies.
Thus the three melodies combined by Wagner in the Meistersinger prelude
do not make classical counterpoint,
for they require a mass of accompanying harmony to explain them.\fP

Forkel recounts, in Ernest Newman's translation:
\f2Bach began teaching composition not with dry counterpoint that led nowhere,
as was the way with other music teachers of his time\ ;\ .\ .\ .
He went immediately to pure four-part thorough-bass,
laying much stress on the setting-out of the voices,
since in this way the conception of the pure progression of the harmony
was made most intelligible.
From there he went to the chorale.
In these exercises he himself set the original bass,
and made his pupils add only the alto and the tenor.
Gradually he let them make the bass also.
Everywhere he insisted not only on the utmost purity of the
harmony in itself, but also on naturalness of progression
and a melodic flow of all the separate voices.\fP
.Lp
Bach, in other words, based his technique at the frontier between
voice-leading and harmony; on how voice-leading should be done so
as to create harmony.  The importance of this approach is that it
is not limited to Bach's voice-leading rules, or  harmonic style.

The forty chorales offered here transcribed for keyboard
are a small selection from the 388 Bach has left us.
The selection is arbitrary, determined largely by easy page-layout
when in alphabetical order, and biased towards the grander
settings and the stand-alone chorales independent of cantatas.
The words are mostly omitted for space reasons, though they do
determine many details of melodic gesture or harmonic movement.
The words can be found at www.uvm.edu/~classics/faculty/bach

Musically there is so much of interest here;
the chromaticism of \f2Es ist genug\fP
will reappear in Berg's violin concerto,
the extravagant voice-crossings in \f2Christum wir sollen loben schon\fP,
the two-and-a-half-bar phrases of \f2Schm√ºcke dich, o liebe Seele\fP
and the five-bar phrases of \f2Uns ist ein Kindlein heut geborn\fP,
the lovely tune and fluent bass-line of
\f2Sollt ich meinem Gott nicht singen\fP, and much else.
.Lp
These pieces can be used for a variety of musicianship
exercises, such as keyboard sight-reading practice,
singing one voice and playing the other three, transposed sight-reading,
and so on.
For this reason, apart from the easily-printable \f2pdf\fP format,
these pieces are also available in \f2muscript\fP format so
that you can generate, for example, midi versions for dictation,
or soprano-bass-only versions for voice-leading practice, etc.
