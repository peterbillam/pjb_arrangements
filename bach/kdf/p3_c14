An important completion
is that of the English composer and pianist Donald Francis Tovey, 1875-1940,
which was published in 1931 on C-clefs in open score
by Oxford University Press and is now out of print.

We should treat as inspiring Tovey's courage in measuring up
to Bach himself on his home territory and at the height of his powers.
Tovey's erudition and hard work
almost achieve the stylistic authenticity that he was seeking.
The set pieces, such as Nottebohm's passage at bar 306
and its inversions at bars 280 and 263, are very fine;
but, especially in the free voices, one can still notice the join.
In the Tovey there are longer runs of parallel thirds or sixths,
more scalic passages, more voice-crossings,
more extremes of register and of texture.
And in the Bach there is a luminous, fluent, quaver-by-quaver,
never-failing beauty that is not easily matched.

While Tovey was at work,
Busoni's \f2Fantasia Contrappuntistica\fP was published,
but Tovey refrained from consulting it until his own work was finished in 1928.
For organ, Michael Ferguson's 1990 completion could be considered; it is
available from Holbrook, 2402 University Ave, Saint Paul, Minnesota 55114, USA.
Very impressive, and the most plausibly Bachian,
is the 1998 completion by Zoltán Göncz,
available from Carus Verlag, number 18.018, ISMN: M-007-09051-7,
see \  \f2www.carus-verlag.com\fP

The current edition is the first to make Tovey's
work available in practical formats.
It is available for keyboard,
and there are parts for SATB recorders,
and for violin, viola and two 'cellos.
In the recorder version, the Bass should preferably be doubled by a Great Bass.
The Alto and Tenor lines divide in the penultimate bar.
There is no separate score; the keyboard edition is recommended instead.
All these are available from \  \f2www.pjb.com.au\fP
