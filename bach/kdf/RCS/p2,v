\f3\s+7Contrapunctus 14\s0\fP
.sp 1.0c

This great final fugue of \f2Die Kunst Der Fuge\fP
was the piece that Bach left unfinished when he died.
Some editions number it as \f2Contrapunctus 19\fP or as \f2Contrapunctus 18\fP.
It is not actually his last composition;
that honour belongs to the chorale prelude on
\f2Vor Deinen Thron Tret' Ich Hiermit\fP
which he dictated to his pupil Altnikol
before taking leave of his family.

.LP

As Bach left \f2Contrapunctus 14\fP, it is a triple fugue:
the first exposition starts at bar 1, the second at bar 114,
and the third, on the notes B-A-C-H, at bar 193.
Bach had previously been very sparing in the use of the notes of his own name,
probably not thinking it appropriate to sign his
life's work before it was complete.
The three subjects are combined at bar 234,
just before Bach's manuscript breaks off in bar 239.
Bach left bar 239 with
all eight quavers of the tenor,
the alto and bass with just their first note,
and with the soprano blank.

.LP

None of the fugue's three subjects is the theme of \f2Die Kunst Der Fuge\fP,
and the \f2Gesamtaufgabe\fP even suggested that this fugue should not
be considered to be part of that work.
In 1880, Gustav Nottebohm pointed out the solution:
the theme of \f2Die Kunst Der Fuge\fP, with one small rhythmic adjustment,
fits in counterpoint with the other three subjects.
This combination can be seen at bar 306 in the current edition.
Nottebohm's  discovery made it clear
that the fugue was intended by Bach as a quadruple fugue
with the theme of \f2Die Kunst Der Fuge\fP as the fourth subject,
and there have since been several attempts to complete the fugue on this basis.

.LP

The most spectacular completion is that of Ferruccio Busoni in his
\f2Fantasia Contrappuntistica\fP of 1912,
which is published by \f2Dover\fP together with the Elegies and Sonatinas.
Stylistically it is sometimes pure Bach, sometimes pure Busoni,
and Busoni moves freely and smoothly between these poles,
demonstrating the unity of the tradition,
and blurring the boundaries between composition, editing, and performance.
After an introduction of 201 bars, followed by Bachs' fugue,
Busoni adds 473 bars of his own,
particularly favouring the eloquent second subject.
