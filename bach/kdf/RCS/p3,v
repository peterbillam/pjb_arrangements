The most plausible completion
is that of the English composer Donald Francis Tovey, 1875 - 1940,
which was published on C-clefs in open score
by Oxford University Press and is now out of print.

.LP
We should treat as inspiring Tovey's courage in measuring up
to Bach himself on his home territory and at the height of his powers.
Tovey's erudition and hard work
almost achieve the stylistic authenticity that he was seeking.
The set pieces, such as Nottebohm's passage at bar 306
and its inversions at bars 280 and 263,
are very fine;
but, especially in the free voices, one can still notice the join.
In the Tovey there are
longer runs of parallel thirds or sixths,
more scalic passages,
more voice-crossings,
more extremes of register and of texture.
And in the Bach there is
a luminous, fluent, quaver-by-quaver, never-failing beauty
that is not easily matched.

.LP
While Tovey was at work,
the \f2Fantasia Contrappuntistica\fP was published,
but he refrained from consulting it until his own work was finished.
His completion measures 78 bars,
and remains the most plausibly Bachian,
and really the only one to choose for instruments other than piano.

.LP
The current edition is the first to make Tovey's
work available in practical formats.
It is available for keyboard,
and there are parts for violin, viola and two 'cellos,
for saxophone quartet,
and for oboe, cor anglais and two basoons.
There is no separate score; the keyboard edition is recommended instead.
All these are available from \f2http:\fP//\f2www.pjb.com.au\fP/\f2mus\fP
