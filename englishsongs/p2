\f3I saw my Lady Weep\fP

I saw my lady weep, and Sorrow proud to be advanced so
In those fair eyes, in those fair eyes where all perfections keep.
Her face was full of woe, full of woe; but such a woe, believe me,
As wins more hearts than mirth can do, with all her enticing parts.
.sp 0.6c
Sorrow was there made fair, and Passions wise, tears a delightful thing;
Silence beyond, silence beyond all speech a wisdom rare.
She made her sighs to sing, sighs to sing; and all things
With a sadness move that made my heart both grieve and love.
.sp 0.6c
O, fairer than aught else the world can show, leave off in time to grieve;
Enough, enough, enough, enough, your joyful looks excel.
Tears kill the heart, believe, kill the heart; O strive not
To be excellent in Woe, which only bring you Beauty's overthrow.
