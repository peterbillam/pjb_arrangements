Presented here is a tiny selection of ten favourite tunes from
Jacob van Eyck's \f2Der Fluyten Lust-Hof\fP.
Hopefully this will server as an introduction to the more complete
editions;
a selection of 15 tunes by Hans-Martin Linde for Schott (1965, OFB 25)
and, especially, the complete editions by
Gerrit Vellekoop published by Ixijzet (1965, XYZ 805-7)
and by Winfried Michel and Hermien Teske
published by Amadeus (1984, BP 705-707).
There is also a facsimile edition by Kees Otten published by Saul B. Groen.

Jonkheer Jacob van Eyck (ca. 1590 - 1657)
was already blind when he was appointed in 1624
as \f2beiermeester\fP (chime-master, or carrillon-player)
of the Utrecht cathedral.
He also played organ and recorder.
Der Fluyten Lust-Hof is a collection of variations on 143 popular tunes,
which he dictated and then "heard through".
It was published in two volumes in 1646.
In 1648 it was reprinted in a second edition,
and the town council gave him a pay-rise of 20 guilders
on the understanding that he "delight the strollers
in the cemetry with the sound of his little flute".
A third edition followed in 1654.
