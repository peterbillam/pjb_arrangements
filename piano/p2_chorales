\f3\s+7Bach Chorales, for piano\s0\fP
.sp 1.5c

.Lp
It is hard to explain the great importance of these simple pieces.
Is is these chorales, rather than his trademark fugues,
that lie at the heart of Bach's technique.
Wolff refers to Bach's \f2collection of 370 four-part
chorales that charted the course for tonal harmony.\fP
Donald Francis Tovey observes:
\f2Counterpoint, the art defined by Sir Frederick Gore Ouseley
as that of 'combining melodies'\. \. \.
This definition is not quite complete.
Classical couterpoint is the conveying of a mass of harmony
by means of a combination of melodies.
Thus the three melodies combined by Wagner in the Meistersinger prelude
do not make classical couterpoint,
for they require a mass of accompanying harmony to explain them.\fP

Forkel recounts, in Ernest Newman's translation:
\f2Bach began teaching composition not with dry counterpoint that led nowhere,
as was the way with other music teachers of his time\ ;\ .\ .\ .
He went immediately to pure four-part thorough-bass,
laying much stress on the setting-out of the voices,
since in this way the conception of the pure progression of the harmony
was made most intelligible.
From there he went to the chorale.
In these exercises he himself set the original bass,
and made his pupils add only the alto and the tenor.
Gradually he let them make the bass also.
Everywhere he insisted not only on the utmost purity of the
harmony in itself, but also on naturalness of progression
and a melodic flow of all the separate voices.\ .\ .\ .
His pupils were not allowed to bring him compositions of
their own until they had fully mastered four-part writing.
Instruction in free composition began with the two-part fugue.\fP

.Lp
Bach, in other words, explored the frontier between voice-leading and harmony;
he solved the problem of how voice-leading should
be done so as to give the impression of harmony.
The great importance of this approach is not just that is is
the basis of Bach's technique; it can also be applied to other
styles than Bach's \- to other sets of consonant chords,
other ways of handling dissonances, and other conventions for voice-leading.
For example in Duke Ellington, it is the logic of the voice-leading
that moves the harmonies of, for example,
\f2Satin Doll\fP, or \f2Prelude to a Kiss\fP

.Lp
Bach told his pupils that every piece of music is a conversation
between the separate voices, that represent the characters.
This human significance of each voice is particularly explicit
in writing for SATB choir.

.Lp
These chorales have perhaps more agility of expression than
any other works of Bach; consider, for example, the contrast
in \f2Es ist genug\fP between the lines
\f2ich fahre sicher hin mit Frieden\fP and
\f2mein groﬂer Jammer bleibt danieden\fP.

.Lp
Of Bach's 370 four-voice chorales, mostly from his cantatas,
a very arbitrary selection has here been made of those
most convenient for piano transcription,
such as those having a low-lying tenor voice.
BWV 18
BWV 26
BWV 43
BWV 104
BWV 145
BWV 155
BWV 262
BWV 288
BWV 306
BWV 318.
For ease of sight-reading, and with some regret,
crossed voices have been uncrossed.
For example, in BWV 318 bar 7 beat 3 and bar 12 beats 3 and 4
between Alto and Tenor.
Often the tenor voice has to be taken in the right hand,
and sometimes the alto in the left.
