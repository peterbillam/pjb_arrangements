\f3\s+7Schubert Dances, for piano four hands\s0\fP
.sp 1.5c

.Lp
twelve Ländler and Waltzes, in triple time,
one in each key signature,
and twelve Ecossaises, in duple time,
also one in each key signature.

.Lp
All in their original keys.
avoid the dreaded oom-pah-pah.
with enough lines for four hands.

.Lp
Useful as very easy pieces for playing with students,
variety of key signatures,
short, strong rhythm.

.Lp
Not just generic anonymous country waltzes,
but little gems of Schubert.
Schubert's trademark dominant chord over a continuing
tonic pedal.
The Op.9 No.14 Waltz in five flats
whose second half begins, full of cheek, in D major,
and returns to Db major through one intermediate chord,
full of grace.
