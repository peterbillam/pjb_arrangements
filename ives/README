  "The Celestial Railroad" is short story written as an allegory by
  American author Nathaniel Hawthorne. In it, Hawthorne parodies the
  seventeenth-century book The Pilgrim's Progress by John Bunyan, which
  portrays a Christian's spiritual "journey" through life. In this story,
  the pilgrim journeys by iron horse rather than by foot, the burden
  of sin that Bunyan portrays is pulled by the same train, and Bunyan's
  figure Evangelist, preaching a message of conversion, is replaced by a
  figure known as "Mr. Smooth-it-away." Hawthorne mostly wrote against
  his own religious belief,[1] popular at the time, Unitarianism or
  Transcendentalism,[2] but according to some educators, several of his
  comments also indicate his dissatisfaction with Bunyan's religiously
  exclusive theology.[3] In addition to this underlying view, however,
  he states "we were rushing by the place where Christian's burden fell
  from his shoulders at the sight of the Cross...for our burdens were rich
  in many things esteemed precious throughout the world." The story ends
  with the traveler's relief that what he'd seen was just a dream and an
  element of hope that is rare in Hawthorne's romantic era literature.

  The American composer Charles Ives based the second movement of his
  Fourth Symphony on Hawthorne's story, expanding on his earlier piece
  for solo piano, also entitled The Celestial Railroad.

In Emerson, his understanding that a multi-dimensional reality exists
  already, just waiting to be experienced anew and met on its own terms;
In Hawthorne, ?
In the Alcotts, domestic tranquility and the support of family
  do not require the trappigs of materialism;
In Thoreau, the realisation that these values can be be reawakened
  only when one pauses long enough to allow the embrace of the cosmic
  and spiritual to penetrate the glossy exterior of superficiality.

According to some accounts, it was called "Crusader's Hymn" because it
was sung by German Crusaders as they made their way to the Holy Land.
But William Jensen Reynolds dismisses as "completely erroneous" any
association of this hymn with the Crusades. The words may have originated
in the Jesuit Order, which came into being after the Crusades. The tune
emerges in Franz Liszt's oratorio Legend of Saint Elizabeth—wherein the
tune forms part of the "Crusader's March"—but no evidence of the tune
exists prior to 1842, when the hymn appeared in Schlesische Volkslieder.

ST. ELIZABETH appears to be an eighteenth-century tune from the Glaz area
of Silesia. It has always been associated with this text. No factual
data exists for the legend that this text and tune date back to the
twelfth-century crusades, although those apocryphal stories explain
one of the names by which this tune is known, namely, CRUSADER'S
HYMN. After Franz Liszt used the tune for a crusaders' march in his
oratorio The Legend of St. Elizabeth (1862), the tune also became known
as ST. ELIZABETH.
The tune consists primarily of a few melodic sequences and their
variations. It could either be sung gently, perhaps with guitar and flute
accompaniment, or it could be sung with great power with almost full
organ for stanzas 1 and 4. Try singing in harmony with no accompaniment
at all for stanzas 2 and 3. Sing in four long lines rather than eight
short phrases.

The Westminster Quarters is the most common name for a clock chime melody
used by a set of four bells to chime on each quarter-hour. The number
of chime sets matches the number of quarter hours that have passed.
It is also known as the Westminster Chimes, or the Cambridge Quarters
from its place of origin, the church of St Mary the Great, Cambridge.
