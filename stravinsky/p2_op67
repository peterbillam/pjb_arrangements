\f3\s+8Two Preludes, \  Alexander Scriabin op.67, 1912-3\s0\fP

Danilewitsch quotes Scriabin:
"my melody is a decomposed harmony, and my harmony is condensed melody."
Indeed, the harmony notes are not a subset,
selected for lower tension, of the melody notes;
they are all of them.
The euphony desirable in longer notes is attained by careful spacing;
this in turn encourages some arpeggiation,
that further blurs the border between the harmonic and melodic realms.
The following observations on the harmonic and rhythmic construction
are mostly gleaned from Manfred Kelkel's book
\f2Alexandre Scriabine:
Sa vie, l'ésotérisme et le langage musical dans son oeuvre\fP,
Éditions Honoré Champion, 7 quai Malaquais, Paris, 1978.

At the time of Op. 67,
Scriabin was using the eight-note scale 1+2+1+2+1+2+1+2 semitones.
Since the pattern repeats every three semitones,
it has only three distinct transpositions.
In the second movement,
the first bars are made from \f2C Db Eb En F# G A Bb\fP;
in bar 1 \f2Db\fP and \f2En\fP are omitted,
in bar 2 the first half has \f2En\fP and \f2G\fP omitted,
and the second half has \f2G\fP and \f2Bb\fP omitted,
a simple rising pattern.

In the slower first movement,
this eight-note scale is expanded to a nine-note scale.
In the first bar, an \f2Ab\fP is added on the barline.
In bar 15, using the second transposition
\f2C# D E F G G# A# B\fP,
an \f2F#\fP is added on the barline,
and the scale-note \f2G\fP is omitted in bar 15 but mentioned in bar 16.
By simple changes of this kind,
Scriabin maintains harmonic rhythm,
and harmonic movement from bar to bar.

Both movements are 35 bars long.
The rhythmic structure of the first is most easily read
by counting the left hand chords in eigth-notes:
there is a six-bar phrase and its repetition,
then a four-bar phrase and its repetition a semitone down,
then a six-bar phrase
and its repetition six semitones down extended to eight bars.

\  \  6 bars: 3+2, 3+2, 3+7, 3+7; \  6 bars: 3+2, 3+2, 3+7, 3+5+2
4 bars: 8+2, 10; \  4 bars: 8+2, 10
6 bars: 3+7, 3+17
8 bars: 3+2, 3+2, 3+5+2, 3+17
last bar: 5

The sections of the second movement are counted in bars.
First there is a ten-bar section (4+2+4),
then a twelve-bar section (4+2+4+2),
then a recapitulation of the ten-bar section (4+2+4),
and then a three-bar conclusion.

In this edition the notes are right but many expression marks are not,
partly through the constraints of my music-typesetting software \f2muscript\fP.
Long slurs have been omitted, and the arpeggiation symbols are missing.
If you're considering playing these pieces,
make sure you consult Peters or Dover or some other more authoritative edition.
The fingering is editorial only; it may help, but can be ignored.
