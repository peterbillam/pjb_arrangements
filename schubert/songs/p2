These arrangements were made when I was a guitarist
accompanying the Swiss tenor Franz Anderegg in the late 1970's.
They are presented here in order of opus number \-
presumably therefore in order of composition.

\f3\s+4Nachtstück\s-4\fP
.LP
Originally written in October 1819 in the dark key of C minor,
this is often sung by tenors a semitone higher in C# minor.
This arrangement is three semitones lower in A minor,
a key which suits baritones as well as guitarists.
When accompanying higher voices,
the guitarist should not hesitate to use a capo at the third or fourth fret.
.LP
This is a song of hermitage and old age,
mist, moon and forest, nature and death.

\f3\s+4Nacht und Träume\s-4\fP
.LP
This was originally written in B major.
This arrangement is two semitones lower in A major,
and the song is singable even by tenors in this key.
If the singer wishes to regain the intended placement in the voice,
the guitarist should not hesitate to use a capo at the second fret.
.LP
This is a song for love of dreams.
The following translation is by the arranger:
.QP
Holy night, you are sinking downwards,
.br
Down too lap the dreams,
.br
Like your moonlight through the rooms,
.br
Through the quiet human breast.
.QP
Who eavesdrop on you with joy,
.br
And cry when the day awakes
.br
Return again, beloved night,
.br
Beloved dreams, return again.

\f3\s+4An die Laute\s-4\fP
.LP
The tricky but showy guitar part
lies in the song's original key of D major.
.LP
This is a song about the intimacy of guitars,
a song in praise of
serenades, whispers, candles, moonlight and the scent of flowers.
How jealous those who can not play the guitar !

\f3\s+4Fischerweise\s-4\fP
.LP
Arranged for voice and two guitars,
this remains on the original key of D major.
It lies so naturally on two guitars that it is hard to remember
it comes from one of Schubert's most pianistic song accompaniments.
.LP
This is a vigorous, confident, young man's song.
