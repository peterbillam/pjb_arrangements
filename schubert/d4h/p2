\f3\s+7Twenty-Four Schubert Dances,\s0
.sp 0.8c
\s+5arranged for Piano Four Hands\s0\fP
.sp 1.5c
.Lp
These well-loved pieces are offered here in new arrangements
for Piano Four Hands, for teaching or social piano playing.
The originals for piano (two hands) are available from \f2Dover\fP, who
in 1989 reprinted the editions by \f2Breitkopf & Härtel\fP of 1889 and 1897.

.Lp
Two dances have been chosen in each of the twelve key signatures,
one in triple time (a Waltz, Ländler or Deutscher) and one
in duple time (an Écossaise).
For four hands, most of these pieces become technically very easy,
in fact some of the Écossaises could serve as first pieces.
Musically they remain extremely rewarding, 
and in a teaching situation offer a solid rhythm,
a variety of moods and key-signatures,
and a joy of music-making which are hard to match.

.Lp
With the Écossaises it was possible to preserve several
sequences intended by Schubert,
but the order of these Waltzes is very arbitrary,
determined largely by the desire to fit two dances onto each page.

.Lp
Schubert writes the Écossaises in two different ways;
some move in crochets and quavers and have eight bars per line,
others in quavers and semiquavers and have four bars per line.
The former should move at \f2doppio movimiento\fP,
taking the same time overall; a good Écossaise tempo
would be about 108 or 112 beats (minims or chrochets) per minute.
As to the nuances in \f2tempo\fP and expression
between Waltzes, Ländler and Deutscher,
I would welcome feedback from people who know these things\ .\ .\ .
