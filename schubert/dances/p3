This selection of German Dances has been arranged for two recorders and guitar.
They are D.971\ no.\ 1, D.420\ no.\ 10, D.769\ no.\ 1,
D.971\ no.\ 2 and D.420\ no.\ 12.
They are taken from \f2Three German Dances\fP D.971,
\f2Two German Dances\fP D.769 (written in January 1824) and
\f2Twelve German Dances\fP D.420 (written in 1817). 
The first three are arranged for
Alto and Tenor recorders and guitar,
then D.971 no. 2 for Soprano, Alto and guitar,
and D.420 no. 12 for two Altos and guitar.

In D.971 no. 2, the Alto recorder has an eight-bar contribution
which gives the opportunity for some practice in C# major scales.
The middle f# is more fluent with the alternative fingering using
just the thumb, and the low G# can be omitted if necessary.
Lucky owners of an A415 instrument
could play the passage a semitone up in D major,
though this tranposition has not been written out here.
In D.420\ no.\ 12, the final note in the top voice
has been moved up from e to a, to give a strong conclusion to the set.

In these dances, the guitar part follows the left hand of the
piano almost exactly \- scarcely one note has been added,
omitted or transposed \- and the result is almost embarrasingly guitaristic.
It is hard to imagine that Schubert did not create these
pieces on the guitar before writing them out for the piano.
