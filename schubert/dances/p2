\f3\s+7Schubert Dances, arranged for recorders and guitar\s0\fP
.sp 1.5c
.LP

These well-loved pieces will never take the place of the Art of Fugue
or the C# minor string quartet Op. 131,
but they are a reliable recipie for happiness.
They are offered here in new arrangements for guitar and recorders,
which should be useful for busking,
or for social recorder playing where half a dozen players
take a few dances each and come together for the Wiener Deutsche.

The originals for piano are available from \f2Dover\fP, who in 1989
reprinted the editions by \f2Breitkopf & Härtel\fP of 1889 and 1897.

\f3\s+4Acht Ländler D.378\s-4\fP
.LP
.nh
The \f2Acht Ländler\fP were written on 13 February 1816.
In this arrangement,
the guitar is written transposing with a capo on the first fret
(alternatively, if A 415 recorders are available, the capo is not needed).
The guitar fingering often uses high positions on the fourth and
fifth string to give strength to the bass line.
Number 6 needs a Tenor recorder,
but an Alto can used if the low E's are played as G's.
If two recorder players are available the second halves of numbers 4 and 5
might also benefit from the change in tone colour offered by the Tenor.
In number 8, the \f3ff\fP second half has been transposed up an octave
to give a strong conclusion to the set.

\f3\s+4Acht Ecossaises D.529\s-4\fP
.LP
.nh
Originally written in February 1817.
In the Dover edition these Ecossaises are split into a group of three,
and another group of five which is incorporated into the twelve German
Dances D. 420, so the order as reconstituted here is somewhat conjectural.

\f3\s+4Wiener Deutsche D.128 no 2\s-4\fP
.LP
.nh
This is the second of the \f2Twelve Viennese Dances\fP, D. 128
and was originally written in about 1812.
The original takes place in the treble clef,
so this transcription for AATB recorders sounds at the original pitch.
The melody is given to the Alto recorder.
Because of divisi in the lower voices,
there should be at least two Tenors and at least two Basses,
so the minimum ensemble would be 2 Altos, 2 Tenors and 2 Basses.
