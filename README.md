pjb_arrangements
================

This is the source code, mostly muscript, for Peter Billam's arrangements.

There are pieces by Bach, Brahms, Carr, Joplin, Handel, Liszt,
Monteverdi, Schoenberg, Schubert, Scriabin, Telemann, and Wilbye,
and collections for recorder, piano, trumpet and voice,
and from the folk tradition.

It is most likely to be of interest:
 * to muscript users, wanting an example of how some layout is done,
 * to musicologists, wanting to investigate the production process,
 * to musicians, wanting to continue or expand some set of scores.

It is hoped that this repository will outlast the original website
