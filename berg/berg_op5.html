The main problem that Berg set himself with the Pieces for Clarinet,
was to compose in a small form with materials
that clearly originate in a large form;
he wanted to discover what would happen
if this contrary tendancy were displayed, rather than being resolved.
Following his inclination to use a difference of viewpoints
as the starting-point,
he solved the problem by applying, at the same time, two contrasted procedures:
<OL><LI>
Omitting the expected continuation and resolution of those materials,
thus giving rise to a series of uncompleted beginnings, and
</LI><LI>
Inserting modifications of the materials,
and dwelling on the junctures between these modifications.
</LI></OL>
The pieces therefore appear,
given the natural tendancies of of their raw material,
both shortened and prolonged.
Performers have two problems,
that stem from Berg's contradictory procedures:
<OL><LI>
While recognising that the visible tendencies of the material
mainly stem from music known to Berg,
how should the pieces be played so that both those tendencies
and Berg's renunciation of them can be heard ?  (for example:
<A HREF="#piece1bar1">in the first bar</A>,
how can the incomplete paraphrase of <I>Till Eulenspiegel</I> be made audible?)
</LI><LI>
Given that the internal structures of the material
- for example, motivic relationships - were put there by the composer,
how should the pieces be played
so that the connections across the joins can be heard,
rather than being either swept aside in the inevitable progress of the piece,
or being obscured by a series of sudden cuts?  (for example: how can
<A HREF="#piece1bar8">the quasi-reprise after the fermata in bar 9</A>
of the first piece
<I>unveil</I> itself, rather than just continuing onwards?)
</LI></OL>

The musician might hope that these problems
- particularly in those two examples -
will solve themselves if he just plays "exactly as written".
This hope is vain, even given Berg's fantastically detailed score.

If it is not understood
that Berg ties notes into a following rest
to indicate a metrical connection
- the rests functioning as the downbeat to the previous phrase -
then the clarinettist will not be able to play the <I>f#</I> in the first bar
as if it were a note on the 4th beat,
and the incomplete paraphrase will remain unheard.
On the other hand, if the clarinettist, when practising the first two bars,
starts an open <I>g</I> on the fourth beat and connects it to the written
<I>G#</I>, and then plays the <I>g</I> more softly every time until it
vanishes, then he will achieve the right effect.

In bar 9, the fermata must be just long enough to break the momentum of the
<I>poco accel</I>, and just short enough that the <I>a</I> in the piano
is still sounding stongly when the left hand restarts:
this <I>a</I> connects the widening intervals in the right hand of bars 8-9
with the opening motif of the piece.
Also, the correct performance of this pivotal moment, when time is in suspense,
is not possible unless the three voices are carefully balanced.
In general, the left and right hands of the piano part
have distinct dynamic markings.
The <I>crescendo</I> in the right hand in bar 7 begins <I>fff</I>.
In the third beat of bar 8 the right hand must already have reached
<I>ffff</I> while the left hand is "only" <I>fff</I>.
The word "<I>dimin.</I>" in the right hand contrasted with the
diminuendo sign in the left hand gives them distinct meanings:
"<I>make</I> a diminuendo" as against
"follow the fading out of the piano's notes".
The diminuendo in the left hand should be huge, whereas the right hand
should still be strong when it reaches the fermata, to match the clarinet.
The pianist can practice this by omitting the last five of the seven chords
leading up to the fermata, listening to the piano's natural diminuendo
and duplicating it with the given right-hand rhythm.
